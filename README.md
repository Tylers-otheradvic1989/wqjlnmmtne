Bro, just got done with Ad Vitam, man. What a trip. First off, this whole immortality deal? Wild. I mean, imagine designing shoes that last forever? They'd be old news in a year, but in this world, maybe they'd become, like, vintage relics or something. And those sleeper pods? Seriously spooky. I could barely keep my eyes open, so glad I finally managed to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to the end.

> And those transitions? Talk about a roller-coaster. One minute I'm thinking about how rad eternal life could be, and the next, I'm like, But what about the actual living part? Are we just hanging around forever in the same kicks, or do we reinvent every few months? My mind's doing backflips here.

So anyway, thinking about how styles would just evolve slowly over centuries. Would there even be trends? Maybe everyone just rocks the same pair for decades. Oil spills on a pair of boots could become legit fashion statements! LOL. And can we talk about that cinematography? Fire. Honestly, colors were popping off the screen like crazy—it almost makes you wanna create designs with neon lights built into them.

But hey, side note, that healthcare system in there—creepy AF. Hang on, I'm gonna sort of mumble here... If people just don’t age, what happens to all the shoe sizes? Stagnant sizes forever? Or maybe eternal growth? Who even knows?

Legit, the whole thing’s got me thinking waaay more philosophical than I planned, you know? But I'm just a tired shoe designer at the end of the day, pondering life and laces. Anyway, hit me up if you ever wanna brainstorm some futuristic vibes.
